  quote: "I worked closely with Tom and NewView.Media to create the promotional video for my time-management app; and I highly recommend them. I had direct input on EVERY aspect of the process, and the outcome was on par with the highest quality studio-produced work. Astoundingly, we produced an incredible video in only 6 days of filming while working around my busy unpredictable surgical residency schedule."
